Karabiner-Elements complex modifications for VEC footpedals

These complex modifiers for Karabiner are examples of configurations for Gen1 (IN-USB-1) and Gen2 (IN-USB-2) Infinity footpedals. These footpedals are marketed as AltoEdge (VEC) and P.I. Engineering devices.

(It bears pointing out that I have not been able to find any USB driver that allows these pedals to be properly recognized under macOS. USB Overdrive 5.1 does see them under macOS Monterey, and though the devices appear as available in Karabiner-Elements via USB Overdrive, KE Event Viewer never sees events when one presses any of the three footpedal buttons.)

Additional background info and details for using the pedals under Linux can be found at https://catswhisker.xyz/log/2018/8/27/use_vecinfinity_usb_foot_pedal_as_a_keyboard_under_linux/
